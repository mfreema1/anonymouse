# Anonymouse :shipit:
Anonymouse is the beginnings of an anonymous question service built for classrooms.
(it's a squirrel, close enough)

## Mission Statement
Being a college student, I recognize the peer pressure against asking questions.  This blocks professors from gauging where their students are at with the material, and degrades the quality of learning for everyone.

I am creating this service to hopefully provide a solution to this issue.  With Anonymouse, students can send questions to their professors in real time without them being broadcast to the classroom.  The professor can see who has asked this question (to discourage abuse of the platform), but is discouraged to reveal them.  Once a professor has received a question, they can either accept the question and broadcast it to the rest of the students for consideration, or, if they think it does not contribute to the discussion, can reject the question, preventing other students from seeing it.

I also just like experimenting with new things, so I have strictly chosen technologies with which I am not very familiar.  They are:
- __Redis__
- __WebSockets__
- __MariaDB__
- __Parcel__

With that said, these technologies did have some though put into them before being chosen, and I believe they fit the bounds of the problem well.
